Project Description:

This project involves the development of a crop recommendation system using machine learning techniques. The system analyzes environmental factors such as nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potassium (K) levels, temperature, humidity, pH, and rainfall to suggest the most suitable crop for a given set of conditions. The code begins by importing necessary libraries and loading a dataset containing these features. Various classification algorithms, including Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machine, Decision Tree, and Random Forest, are employed to predict the optimal crop. The performance of these models is evaluated using accuracy and confusion matrix metrics.
